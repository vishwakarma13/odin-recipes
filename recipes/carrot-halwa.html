        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Gajar ka Halwa, also known as Carrot Halwa, is a classic and beloved Indian dessert. It's a rich, sweet, and comforting pudding that is especially popular during the winter months when fresh red carrots are in season.

            The traditional recipe involves slow-cooking grated carrots with full-fat milk, sugar, and a generous amount of ghee (clarified butter). The slow cooking process allows the carrots to become tender and absorb the creamy milk, which reduces down to form a rich, thick texture.
